# nvim-ide
This repository contains the configuration to setup nvim as ide.

This repository is based on the tutorial given by theprimeagen on YouTube to setup neovim from scratch. After that I added some more plugins that I need on the way while doing software development in C++.

# Steps
The first step is to configure the Packer to install all other packer manager. To install the packer use the following command.
```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim```
For C++ it uses Clangd.
